  The secure part of our website uses an
  %a{ :href => 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate' } Extended Validation Certificate
  indicated by the green address bar in your browser.  This provids our customers with an assurance the site is operated by an established business with an verified owner and physical presence.
  The certificate and organization validation is provided by

  All credit card information is immediately sent encrypted and stored exclusively by CISP/PCI Compliant
  %a{:href => 'http://www.trustcommerce.com/', :target => 'other'} TrustCommerce.
  Our site stores a TrustCommerce billing id that allows charging and crediting cards entered but the card details can not be retrieved.  Accordingly, your credit card information is safe from security compromises to our web site or from any other person who gains full access to our web server.  If a customer enters their own credit card information on our site, that card information is more secure than most other times credit cards are used.
